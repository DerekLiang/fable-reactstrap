# Fable Reactstrap

## Documentation

https://nojaf.github.io/fable-reactstrap

## Contributing

Most of the library has been ported to Fable.

Not all samples are there yet, you can always help me out by converting a page from [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).

Please create an issue if something is missing or you want an api change.

## Developing

> yarn

Should install both JS and .NET packages.

> yarn start

Should launch the documentation server at http://localhost:8080.
